1. Pick a name for the class OneNote notebook that is fairly simple and easy to remember, and a corresponding FQDN as a subdomaon of scheidel.net. We're looking for a OneNote notebook name that's easy for students to remember and closely associated with the event, with a matching FQDN that is easy to remember, short, and easy to type.

   For example, for SEC530 at the SANS Cyber Architecture in the United Arab Emirates (AE) we picked a OneNote notebook name of `CA 2020 AE - SEC530` and an FQDN of `ca2020ae.scheidel.net`.

2. Create a OneNote notebook with the assigned name.

    - Open OneNote on the web
    - Under the list of **My Notebooks**, click **+ New**

3. Update sharing and editing access, and get the page's sharable URL.

   Note: For the time being we're trying to avoid using a shared editing password. We might have to staring using passwords if there are ever problems with people maliciously mucking with the notebook.

    - Access the notebook via OneNote on the web
    - In the top-right corner, click on **Share**
    - Click on **Anyone with the link can edit**
    - Set an expiration date and click **Apply**
    - Click on **Copy link** to get a shareable link; copy to clipboard
    - Close the dialog
